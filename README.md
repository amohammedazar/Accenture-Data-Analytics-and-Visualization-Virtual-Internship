## 📂 Task 2: Data Identification and Cleaning

### Data Model

To identify the necessary datasets, I referred to this [Data Model](https://github.com/amohammedazar/Accenture-Data-Analytics-and-Visualization-Virtual-Internship/blob/main/Data%20model.pdf). Key datasets identified:

- **Reaction Score** (to quantify popularity)
- **Content ID**
- **Reaction Types**
- **Content Type**
- **Category**

### 🧹 Data Cleaning Process

- Removed rows with missing values
- Changed data types for consistency
- Dropped irrelevant columns
- Removed white spaces
- Modified cases for consistency
- Deduped Masterfile
- Removed punctuations and unwanted characters

**Resulting Cleaned Datasets:**

- [Reaction Types](https://github.com/amohammedazar/Accenture-Data-Analytics-and-Visualization-Virtual-Internship/blob/main/ReactionTypes.csv)
- [Reactions](https://github.com/amohammedazar/Accenture-Data-Analytics-and-Visualization-Virtual-Internship/blob/main/Reactions.csv)
- [Content](https://github.com/amohammedazar/Accenture-Data-Analytics-and-Visualization-Virtual-Internship/blob/main/content.xlsx)
